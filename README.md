Final Project for ME4565

The final project for this class was split into part A and part B. General results were recorded in ME4565 Final Project.pdf

<h2>Part A</h2>
projectA.pdf and projectA.py numerically solve the nondimensionalized 1D heat equation for different Biot numbers. The finite difference scheme is used with the explicit and implicit approach. The stability of the explicit and implicit schemes were analyzed as well.

<h2>Part B</h2>
projectB.py and projectBcentral.py numerically solve the velocity and pressure distribution over a planar 2D nozzle using the SIMPLE algorithm (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations).
